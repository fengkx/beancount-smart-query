${oneLine`
Beancount modify the SQL SELECT syntax to provide a two-level filtering syntax:
since we have a single table of data,
we replace the table name in FROM by a filtering expression which applies over transactions, and the WHERE clause applies to data pulled from the resulting list of postings:
`
}
${oneLine`
SELECT <target1>, <target2>, â€¦
FROM <entry-filter-expression>
WHERE <posting-filter-expression>;
 `
}
${oneLine`Both filtering expressions are optional.
If no filtering expressions are provided,
all postings will be enumerated over.
Note that since the transactions are always filtered in date order,
the results will be processed and returned in this order by default.`}
